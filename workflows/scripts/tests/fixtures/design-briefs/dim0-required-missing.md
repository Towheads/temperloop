# Design brief: fixture — in-flight brief missing dimension 0

Purpose-built FAILING fixture (temperloop#512): an in-flight (`status: draft`)
brief that is otherwise fully conformant across kernel dimensions 1..16 but
OMITS the `## 0.` (Premise & null hypothesis) heading. Because it is
non-ratified it is IN SCOPE for the conditional dimension-0 requirement, so it
must FAIL with a MISSING-DIMENSION for kernel dimension 0 — proving the
enforcement actually bites for new/in-flight briefs (not merely disabled for
ratified ones). It differs from minimal-conformant.md (now ratified/exempt)
only in `status:`; that single per-brief signal flips it from exempt to
enforced.

## 1. Problem & outcome (stranger standpoint)
disposition: filled
Fixture problem statement, fixture outcome statement.

## 2. Audience & interaction modes
disposition: filled
Fixture audience; fixture interaction mode.

## 3. Alignment (guiding principles / routing)
disposition: filled
Fixture alignment rationale.

## 4. Contract seams (Produces / Consumes / Acceptance)
disposition: filled
**Produces:** fixture output.
**Consumes:** fixture input.
**Acceptance:** fixture check.

## 5. Command/mechanism shape
disposition: n/a — this fixture proposes no new command

## 6. Scalability & resource impact
disposition: filled
Fixture cost tier: negligible.

## 7. Maintainability
disposition: filled
Fixture coupling note.

## 8. Testability
disposition: filled
Fixture: fully mechanically gated by the fixture suite itself.

## 9. Telemetry & measurement proxies
disposition: deferred → temperloop#999
Fixture proxy sketch; full wiring deferred.

## 10. Upgrade path
disposition: filled
Fixture: no contract-surface change.

## 11. Uninstallability / reversibility
disposition: n/a — no runtime component; this fixture is a static document

## 12. First-run experience
disposition: filled
Fixture first-run note.

## 13. Docs & marketing surface
disposition: filled
Fixture doc surface note.

## 14. Security / privacy
disposition: n/a — no personal/org content in this fixture

## 15. Failure modes, degradation & capability limits
disposition: filled
Fixture failure story.

## 16. Adoption & enforcement
disposition: filled
Fixture: replaces no existing default.
